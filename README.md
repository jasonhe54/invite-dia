This product is not created by, created with, endorsed by, or supported by Dia, BCNY, or any other relevant legal entity. This is merely the result of another student suggesting a tool like this.

Any user information provided to this product is used for the sole purpose of allowing you to invite users to Dia from any browser on behalf of your Dia account. This product does NOT store, transmit, sell or utlize any user information beyond what is necessary to allow you to invite users to Dia from any web browser, and this communication occurs with Dia ONLY.

This tool may help facilitate Dia OpenTab events as well, assuming usage of the tool is allowed by Dia.

Your Dia login is necessary to provide you access to this tool. This product uses native Dia APIs - the same APIs that Dia, the browser, uses.

Since Dia has not documented said APIs, those API Endpoints are hidden from the source and configured via Environment Variables.

Usage of this tool comes with ***no expressed or implied warranty***. This tool may break at any moment were Dia to alter the functionality of their APIs.
